# Trello-Status-Parsing
This is a lightweight tool that helps track the status of cards across selected Trello lists. It extracts the **first line of each card's description** (used as a status), filters out archived cards, groups them by list, and exports the results into a cleanly formatted Word document.

# Why I Built This
Trello is great for organizing partnership pipelines and project tracking, but exporting structured status updates for reporting or sharing can be tedious. This script automates that process, making it easy to generate a readable status report from a Trello board export ‚Äî especially useful for program managers, partnership teams, or research project coordinators.

# Features
- Filters only the lists you care about (customizable)
- Skips archived cards
- Extracts the **first line** of each card‚Äôs description as the status
- Exports to `.docx` (Word) with:
  - Bold section headers (list names)
  - Bullet-style formatting for card titles
  - Indented sub-bullet for statuses

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Output
== "List 1 Name" ==<br>
‚Ä¢"Card 1 Name"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Status: "Text in First Line of card"
  <br>
‚Ä¢"Card 2 Name"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Status: "Text in First Line of card"
<br>

== "List 2 Name" ==<br>
‚Ä¢"Card 1 Name"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Status: "Text in First Line of card"
  <br>
‚Ä¢"Card 2 Name"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Status: "Text in First Line of card"
<br>
